- Log in to [PESUAcademy](https://www.pesuacademy.com/Academy/s/studentProfilePESU).
- Open the developer tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting `Inspect Element` (Hotkey: `F12` or `CTRL+SHIFT+I`).
- Navigate to the `Network` tab and filter for all requests.
- Go to the attendance page and select your semester.
- Look for a network request to `/studentProfilePESUAdmin` and click on it.
- In the `Payload` or `Request` tab, locate the form data. 
- - It should look like: `controllerMode=6407&actionType=8&batchClassId=2660&menuId=660`
- - The `batchClassId` value `2660` is what you need to for your `BATCH_CLASS_ID` key
- Define your `SUBJECT_MAPPING` in key-value pairs based on your subjects.
